This repository contains the example programs, corresponding to the three-part tutorial on detecting scene changes in videos with Python and OpenCV, which can be found at:

 1. [Simple Threshold/Fade-to-Black Detection](http://www.bcastell.com/tech-articles/pyscenedetect-tutorial-part-1/)
 2. [Optimized/Adaptive Threshold Detection](http://www.bcastell.com/tech-articles/pyscenedetect-tutorial-part-2/)
 3. Content-Aware Scene Changes (coming soon!)

You can get the latest sample code/video from [the releases page](https://github.com/Breakthrough/python-scene-detection-tutorial/releases).  All files in the `examples/` directory are released into the public domain.  In total, there are three programs (`part1-threshold.py`, `part2-adaptive.py`, and still under development, `part3-content-aware.py`) corresponding to the respective part in the tutorial linked above.  Usage details for each program can be found in the comment header for that file.

Related to this tutorial is [PySceneDetect](http://www.bcastell.com/projects/pyscenedetect/), a robust OpenCV-based scene detection program.
